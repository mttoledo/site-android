# site-android

My first website, developed after completing modules 1 and 2 of the course of HTML5 + CSS3 from CursoemVÃ­deo, taught by Gustavo Guanabara.

I did my best to ensure that the website was responsive, following the guidelines proposed by the course instructor.

With the project, I was able to consolidate the content learned, from basic HTML5 and CSS3 fundamentals to website responsiveness.
